    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <P>I’m a faith-filled, family-oriented person who finds joy in the simple things—like cooking a good meal, sharing laughs with loved ones, and serving in my church and community. I believe in showing love through action, whether that’s organizing events, supporting others, or just being someone people can count on. My favorite meal is red beans and rice with chicken—it reminds me of home, comfort, and the warmth of togetherness. I’m always growing, learning, and leaning into the purpose God has for my life, and I try to carry kindness and gratitude with me wherever I go.</P>

        <h4>Red beans and rice with chicken</h4>
        <p>Red beans and rice with chicken is more than just a meal to me—it’s a taste of home and comfort. Every time I eat it, I’m reminded of cozy family dinners, laughter around the table, and the rich, savory smell that fills the kitchen while it cooks. The tender chicken, seasoned just right, mixed with creamy red beans and fluffy rice, makes it the perfect combination of flavor and warmth. It’s a dish that brings back good memories and always leaves me feeling satisfied and connected to my roots.</p>
